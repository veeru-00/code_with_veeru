## Embedded System Overview

An embedded system is a combination of computer hardware and software designed for a specific purpose.

### Characteristics

* Equipped with a processing unit
* Includes temporary memory and permanent storage
* Part of larger systems
* Customized for specific purposes
* Cost-effective compared to general-purpose systems

### Real-world Impact

* Embedded systems are integral to daily life

## Security System Example

### Option 1: Generic Purpose Computer

**Approach:** Use PC + camera + OpenCV

**Pros:**

* Fast development

**Cons:**

* Not product-friendly (large, slow, costly, insecure)

### Option 2: Raspberry Pi

**Pros:**

* Lower cost
* Compact

**Cons:**

* Contains unnecessary hardware

### Option 3: Custom Embedded System

**Approach:** Custom PCB + camera module + embedded software

**Pros:**

* Cost-optimized
* Feature-specific design

**Cons:**

* Higher development time and complexity

### 1. Applications

* Located in: `/bin`, `/sbin`, `/usr/bin`
* Examples: BusyBox, Python, OpenSSL

### 2. Services

* Init systems: systemd, upstart, SysV init
* Examples: UDEV, SSHD, Bluetooth, Network services

### 3. Libraries

* Core: glibc, musl, uClibc
* Others: QT, Boost, OpenSSL, POSIX, Pthread, EGL, etc.

### 4. System Call Interface

* Interface between user space and kernel
* Examples: open, close, read, write

### 5. Drivers

* Located in `/dev`
* Examples: USB, I2C, touchscreen, FM tuner

### 6. Linux Kernel

* MMU, Process Management, IPC, VFS, Network Stack

### Supporting Tools

* Bootloader: Initializes hardware
* Toolchain: Cross-compilation tools
* Common tools: GCC, CMake, Make

---

## Customizing Embedded Linux Distributions

### Additions

* Applications, services, libraries, drivers, splash screens

### Omissions

* GUI environments, generic services, unused drivers
* Minimal bootloader + kernel for fast boot

```
Qualcomm interview questions :
Q.How drivers interact with h/w ..?
Ans : Device drivers act as a communication bridge between the operating system (OS) and hardware devices.
They translate high-level OS requests into low-level hardware-specific instructions and handle interrupts or
events generated by the hardware.
Q.Explain about Services?
Ans :  services are background processes (also called daemons) that start during boot or when triggered and
run without user interaction. They provide core system functions like networking, logging, scheduling, and more.
These services are managed by service manager.Most modern Linux distributions use systemd as the service manager.
